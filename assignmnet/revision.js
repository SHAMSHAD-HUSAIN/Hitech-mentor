2.Write a program that declares three variables (one for each data type: string, number, and boolean), assigns values to them, and then prints the values and types of these variables.let name = "Alice";           // String
let age = 30;                // Number
let isMember = true;         // Boolean

console.log(name, typeof name);
console.log(age, typeof age);
console.log(isMember, typeof isMember);

3.Write a program that declares a variable and initializes it with an integer value. Perform both pre-increment and post-increment operations on the variable and print the results.

console.log("Pre-increment:", preIncrement); // 6
console.log("After pre-increment:", num); // 6

console.log("Post-increment:", postIncrement); // 6
console.log("After post-increment:", num); // 7

if (score >= 90) {
    grade = "A";
} else if (score >= 80) {
    grade = "B";
} else if (score >= 70) {
    grade = "C";
